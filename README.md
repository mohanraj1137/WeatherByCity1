The Task-2 of the Codtech Internship involved developing a Java-based REST API client that consumes a public REST API, such as a weather data provider, and presents the fetched data in a structured format. This task focused on practical implementation of core Java skills, particularly handling HTTP requests, parsing JSON responses, and managing user input. To achieve this, the program was built using Javaâ€™s HttpClient for sending GET requests and the Jackson library for JSON parsing. The application takes a city name from the user (like Chennai or Mumbai), then fetches the corresponding latitude and longitude using the Open-Meteo Geocoding API. With the obtained coordinates, it sends a second request to the Open-Meteo Weather Forecast API to retrieve real-time weather data. The response includes vital weather details such as temperature, wind speed, and observation time, which are then neatly displayed in the console. This project not only demonstrates how to integrate third-party APIs into a Java application, but also highlights the importance of real-time data retrieval and formatting. It enhanced our understanding of client-server communication, JSON handling, and building responsive console applications that interact with live APIs. Through this task, I also learned how to deal with potential issues like handling missing data or invalid user input, and I gained hands-on experience with clean coding practices, exception handling, and modular programming. Moreover, the project meets industry-relevant standards by simulating a real-world scenario where dynamic user input drives the logic and output. This task was highly beneficial in solidifying my API knowledge and provided a practical demonstration of how Java can be effectively used in real-world applications such as weather monitoring tools. Overall, it was a rewarding and insightful experience that built both technical skills and confidence in developing API-driven applications.
